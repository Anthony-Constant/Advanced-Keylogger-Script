<h2> WHAT IS IT? </h2>
Created an Advanced Python Keylogger script.

<h2> HOW IT WORKS </h2>
Created an Advanced Python Keylogger script. Once the script has been executed, it will automatically create a key_log.txt file on the local machine and writes anything which is typed on the keyboard (all keystrokes) to the file created.

Every 10 seconds, the script automatically sends the key_log.txt file to a specified email address using SMTP.  

<h2> HOW TO USE IT </h2>
Run the script. <br>
<br> Allow the script to do its job. <br>
